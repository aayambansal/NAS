## Introduction
The goal of this project is to automate the design of neural networks for robotic control using NAS. Traditional control systems often rely on manually designed neural networks, which can be suboptimal and time-consuming. This implementation leverages NAS to find optimal architectures, achieving significant improvements in control accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- Implements Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with a focus on robotic control tasks.
- Uses PyBullet to create simulation environments for a 6-DOF robotic arm.
- Evaluates neural network architectures on metrics such as control accuracy, response time, and computational efficiency.
- Generates visualizations to compare different architectures across iterations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `numpy`
- `pybullet`
- `matplotlib`

To install the required Python packages, run:
```sh
pip install numpy pybullet matplotlib
```

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nas-robotic-control.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd nas-robotic-control
```

Install the required dependencies using pip (as mentioned above).

Usage

Run the Python program to perform NAS and evaluate results:
```sh
python main.py
```
After execution, the program will output the best architecture found and generate the following result figures:

Results:

The program performs a search over various neural network architectures using a reinforcement learning-based approach. The results are summarized in the following figures:

Control Accuracy: Shows how the NAS-generated architectures improve control accuracy across iterations.
Response Time: Evaluates the response time of different architectures.
Computational Efficiency: Compares the FLOPs required by different architectures.
Stability: Indicates the variance in control outputs for stability.
Performance Score: A combined performance metric used to identify the best architecture.

Future Work:

Extend to Multi-Robot Systems: Adapt the framework to work with multiple robots for coordinated tasks.
Hardware Integration: Incorporate hardware constraints in the search process to optimize architectures for real-world deployment.
Real-World Validation: Test the NAS-generated architectures in real-world scenarios beyond the simulation environment.
